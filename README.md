## 🔍 What It Does
This is a semantic resume matcher.
It lets HR or recruiters paste a job description, and returns the **top 5 most relevant candidates** using LLM-based sentence embeddings.

Instead of keyword search, it understands meaning — "data science" and "machine learning" won't be treated as unrelated.

---

## 🧠 Tech Used
- SentenceTransformer (MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Hub (token required for model load)
